# SVG-Generator

## Description
This command-line tool generates a customized SVG logo based on user input. User input is collected via the VSCode integrated terminal using Inquirer version 8.2.4. It prompts the user to provide the following information: initials, initials color, shape (with options for circle, triangle, or square), and shape color. After the user provides input for these parameters, the generator creates an SVG logo file with the specified characteristics.
